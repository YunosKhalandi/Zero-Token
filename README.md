# Zero Token

ZERO is a token built on the Polygon platform.

Zero Token liquidity pool is based on the Tether (USDT) token. This token does not have the ability to decrease in price, and it will not go below any price it reaches.

The creators of the ZERO token do not have the ability to mint this token in any desired
amount, and a new token will not be minted until Tether (USDT) is deposited into the liquidity pool.

The token started with an initial supply of 0 tokens, and the creators were obligated to deposit
1 Tether into the liquidity pool to mint 1000000 ZERO and to ensure that the initial price of ZERO was 0.000001 Tether.

Subsequently, the minting of new tokens is conditional upon depositing new Tether into the liquidity pool. Both the creators and other users must deposit Tether into the liquidity pool to buy tokens, and in return, new tokens will be minted for them.

If an individual wishes to sell their ZERO tokens, their tokens will be burned, and an equivalent amount of Tether will be transferred from the liquidity pool to their wallet address. Only ZERO token holders (based on their token amounts) have access to the liquidity pool, and the withdrawal of liquidity without burning ZERO tokens is not possible, even for the creators of the token.

# Ways to increase the liquidity pool volume:

1. Token Purchase and Sale Fees: Users buying the token will incur a 2.5% fee based on Tether, with 2% of that fee being deposited into the liquidity pool. Similarly, a 2.5% fee based on Tether will be charged for selling the token, with 1.5% of that fee being added to the liquidity pool. These Tether deposits into the liquidity pool lead to an increase in the price of the ZERO token, resulting in profits for token holders. The remaining 0.5% of buying and 1% of selling fee will be allocated to the development team, allowing them to provide more services for increased income and enhance the value of the liquidity pool.

2. Development Team's Online Games: In exchange for the received fees, the development team will design online games on the blockchain platform. These games, being designed as smart contracts, offer traceability and accurate invoicing for their earnings. 40% of the fees collected from these games will be directly and automatically deposited into the liquidity pool through the blockchain. With the liquidity pool's volume increasing and the number of ZERO tokens remaining constant, the price of ZERO will rise, resulting in profits for token holders.

3. Blockchain-Based Advertising System: The development team will design a blockchain-based advertising system where users can generate income and engage in part-time activities. This system, implemented as smart contracts, ensures traceability and precise income reporting. 40% of the fees collected from the blockchain advertising system will be directly and automatically added to the liquidity pool through the blockchain. With the liquidity pool's volume increasing and the number of ZERO tokens remaining constant, the price of ZERO will rise, leading to profits for token holders.

4. Blockchain Marketplace System: The development team will create a blockchain-based multi-store marketplace where users can generate income and engage in part-time activities. Additionally, users can fulfill their daily needs through this platform. Similar to the previous systems, this marketplace will also be designed as smart contracts, ensuring traceability and accurate income reporting. 40% of the fees collected from the blockchain marketplace system will be directly and automatically deposited into the liquidity pool through the blockchain. As the liquidity pool's volume increases and the number of ZERO tokens remains steady, the price of ZERO will rise, resulting in profits for token holders.

# Why ZERO?

As the ecosystem develops with these initiatives, token holders (Holders) are expected to benefit from the increasing value of the ZERO token due to the expanding liquidity pool.

Given the trend of changes in the liquidity pool and the price of ZERO, this token represents a new type of token where its liquidity pool is constantly changing (either increasing or decreasing in volume), but the price of ZERO is consistently increasing, and there is no possibility of price decrease.

Since the control over the liquidity pool volume is beyond the reach of everyone and users have no control over it, there will never be an issue for users to sell, and anyone can easily sell their tokens whenever they wish.

Considering that each purchase is equivalent to the minting of new tokens and each sale is equivalent to burning the previous tokens, issues like sell pressure or buy pressure, as well as sudden price fluctuations, will not occur in this token. The growth of this token will always be positive and continuous.

Given that the control of the liquidity pool is outside the hands of ZERO creators and due to security concerns, the ZERO creators and the development team will not reveal their identities. This project will be in the hands of the public, allowing users to grow their assets through their activities. The ZERO creators and the development team will make every effort to provide more services and will be alongside their users throughout the growth journey of this token.
